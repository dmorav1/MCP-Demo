"""Test configuration & shared fixtures.

Previously this file was intentionally minimal. Integration tests were failing
with `psycopg.errors.UndefinedTable` because they rely on the application's
default database dependency (engine from `app.database`) while no automatic
schema creation occurred inside the test process (the import of `app.main`
may happen before the database is ready or against an empty instance).

To make integration tests deterministic we create (once per session) the
database schema for the engine used by the production dependency injection.
Unit-style tests in `test_api.py` already override the dependency and manage
their own schema lifecycle; this global fixture is lightweight and safe.
