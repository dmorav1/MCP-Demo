We're getting frequent `504` timeouts in the frontend app. It seems intermittent but is impacting our enterprise users the most. Can you take a look? I can provide HAR files if needed.",

Looks like a classic N+1 query problem in our `PermissionsService`. We're fetching the user's roles, and then iterating through them to fetch permissions for each role one by one.",
