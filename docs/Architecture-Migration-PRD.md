# Product Requirements Document: Hexagonal Architecture Migration

## Overview

### Background
The current MCP RAG Demo uses a traditional layered architecture that has served as a solid foundation. However, as the system grows and evolves, we need to migrate to a more maintainable, testable, and flexible architecture that supports:

- Multiple interfaces (REST API, MCP protocol, Slack bot)
- Pluggable embedding providers (local, OpenAI, future providers)
- Easy testing and mocking
- Clear separation of business logic from infrastructure concerns

### Business Objectives
1. **Improve code maintainability** - Reduce coupling between layers
2. **Enhance testability** - Enable comprehensive unit and integration testing
3. **Increase flexibility** - Support easy swapping of infrastructure components
4. **Professional architecture** - Align with enterprise-grade patterns
5. **Better LangChain integration** - Leverage industry-standard RAG patterns

## Current State Analysis

### Current Architecture
- **Monolithic layered approach** with tight coupling
- **Direct dependencies** from business logic to infrastructure
- **Custom RAG implementation** without industry-standard patterns
- **Limited testability** due to hard dependencies
- **Embedding service** supports local and OpenAI but not easily extensible

### Technical Debt
- Business logic mixed with infrastructure concerns
- Difficult to mock dependencies for testing
- Hard to swap embedding providers
- Custom chunking and retrieval logic vs. proven patterns

## Target Architecture: Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)

### Core Principles
1. **Domain-centric design** - Business logic at the center
2. **Dependency inversion** - Domain defines interfaces, infrastructure implements
3. **Separation of concerns** - Clear boundaries between layers
4. **Technology agnostic core** - Domain independent of frameworks
